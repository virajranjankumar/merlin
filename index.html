    <h2>Fleet Management</h2>
    <p>Field deployments and management of multiple AGV's is challenging and takes a substative amount of time. This leads to lost time due to halting production lines and factory floors.<p>
    <p>Our solution is a methodical system which guides enterprises from the moment they switch on their AGV<p>
    <p>We want to make the make the task of managing multiple AGV's as simple as managing one.</p>

    <h2>Open and Extensible</h2>
    <p>The system is built from the ground up with open API's to allow any AGV system to connect and be actuated from a central system.</p>
    <p>This design prevents vendor lock-in and allows future AGV vendors to easily interface with an organizations exisitng AGV managemetn system.</p>

    <h2>Effortless Monitoring</h2>
    <p>Laser guided AGV's deployed on warehouse and productions sites need continuous monitoring so that any potential issues are caught early.</p>
    <p>Most newer AGV systems do not come with the tools and infustructure for long-term, multi-user/multi-AGV deployment scenarios. Our solution intends to fill that gap and provide the enterpise with the tools they need to monitor their automation investments.</p>

Part 3. Business Details
1. Executive Summary of the Business/Project Business Idea, Creativity, Uniqueness  
The product is a cloud application which allows enterprises to design, operate and plan material handling using AGV's

Target Customers  
Automated guided vehicle vendors and organizations which need to install, operate, coordinate and maintain multiple AGVs

Characteristics of the Market: 

2. What exactly is your product or service? Describe your product or service and its specificity

Currently the process of installing, operating, maintaining and planning an AGV system consisting of more than a handful of AGV's is immature and difficult. One of the reasons for this is that most of the AGV vendors have concentrated thier efforts on the hardware and algorithms to handle basic movements and collision avoidance. While this is useful for a single AGV, they are not the appropriate tools with which to manage muliple AGV's. Most AGV's also don't have appropriate software tools for dynamically changing the routes that the AGV follows and requires a non-trivial effort and software changes. These make the AGV's less dynamic and don't help factory managers and warehouses to adapt to changing demand and traffic environments.

We want to provide a software system which addresses the above problems as follows:
- Provide a simple user interface, simmilar to Google Maps, with the layout of the indoor floor and allow factory managers to qickly design and plan routes that the AGVs should follow.
- The AGV's take commands from a central server which coordiantes the movements of the AGV from a central location. This allows for features such as fleet management and optimized routing, which requires a global view of the system and the position of all the AGV's
- Have a calendar-like scheduling system which will allow managers to schedule work and have the details of which AGV should handle it managed sperately and independently by software.

There is currently a major shift in the AGV market which has been make possible with the advancement in robotics algorithms and cheap but reliable sensors. These same advancements are what have made automous cars technically and economically feasable.

Traditional AGV's have relied on making modifications to the warehouse or factory in which they are installed, such as laying guide wires or magnetic tapes. This comes with some serious disadvantages which prevents mass adoption of AGV's and installing large AGV systems, only organizations which own their own facilities can afford to make such modifications.

The two trends above have allowed many new AGV vendors such as clearpath robotics OTTO and fetch robotics to enter the market at a lower price and offer services to newer customer groups such as e-commerce vendors.


3. What stage of the project development are you in? Indicate the schedule of your business (starting date, registration, achievements)
We are currently in the design and prototyping stage. We have developed some prototypes and tested out the feasability of the solution. We started working on the idea in April and we intend to further spend resources in implementing the soltuion.

4. What is your business model? Describe how the business will reach its customers and generate revenue
The business model chosen is a Licensing model per installation if enterprises chose to install the software on premises and a subscription model if they chose to use a cloud service which we will manage.

5. What are your main competitors? Describe the competitive environment of your product/service
Clearpath Operating System: http://www.ottomotors.com/software


6. Who are the people composing the team? Describe your team and your future hiring plans
The team consists of 2 members with professional expereince in robotics and web development. We bring work and educational experiences from Singapore, Canda and France. In the future we intend to hire software engineers, web developers, mobile developers and robotics engineers.

7. What is your budget planning? Describe your recent budget status and budget plans
The budget will mainly be allocated to computer equipment and cloud services for developing the software and running robotics simulations. Sensors such as stereo cameras, Kinetic and Lidars may also be needed during development and testing. We haven't spent money thus far, instead spending time to develop software prototypes and testing out feasability and ideas.

Part 4. Activity plan in Korea
1. What is your strategy or direction of your business in Korea
Meet with AGV suppliers and users. Incorporate the feedback from these customers into the product in order to better understand and serve their needs. These may be traditonally large manufactures or newer e-commerce companies which handle multiple goods and warehouses

2. Describe your activity plans in Korea with details
- Meet with users of large scale AGV installations
- Talk with them and better understand their pain points when coordinating and deploying multiple AGV's
- Incorporate that feedback into software solution

3. What support and education/training are you expecting for your business in Korea?
- Access to Venture Capital and a chance to demo our solution to them
- Legal, tax and marketing
- Further access to software developers and roboticists
- Help with accessing the futher Asian market
